    "#### What are the main objectives of the Artificial Intelligence Act?\n",
    "The main objectives are to lay down harmonized rules for the development, marketing, and use of AI systems in the EU, ensuring they are trustworthy, safe, and align with EU values, while also promoting innovation and the free movement of AI products and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How does the Act define \"high-risk AI systems\"?\n",
    "High-risk AI systems are defined by their potential impact on health, safety, and fundamental rights. These include systems used in critical sectors such as law enforcement, employment, and essential services, where failure could cause significant harm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are the key obligations for operators under this Act?\n",
    "Operators must ensure their AI systems comply with strict requirements for transparency, risk management, data governance, and human oversight. They are also required to maintain technical documentation and keep records to demonstrate compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How does the Act address the protection of personal data?\n",
    "The Act emphasizes that it does not override existing EU data protection laws, such as the GDPR. It ensures AI systems are designed and used in ways that protect personal data, and individuals retain all their rights under existing data protection regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What sectors does the Act specifically mention as benefiting from AI?\n",
    "The Act mentions sectors like healthcare, agriculture, education, transportation, public services, and environmental management as areas where AI can provide significant economic, societal, and environmental benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How does the Act ensure the free movement of AI-based goods and services within the EU?\n",
    "By establishing uniform rules and standards for AI systems, the Act prevents individual Member States from imposing their own regulations, thus facilitating the seamless cross-border movement and market access of AI products and services throughout the EU.\n"
